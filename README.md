# TerrainGeneration
-------------

Some terrain generation algorithms (with visualization). Documented.

## Quadtree generations

 A quadtree structure that stores a 'filled' quadtrant status to store where there is terrain. This is optimized to merge nodes with the same information type on all children. This store less nodes.

## Fractal generation

 A fractal simple 'island' generator with buttons to tweak fractal generation. Basically an implementation of [fractal](http://nick-aschenbach.github.io/blog/2014/07/06/2d-fractal-terrain/)
